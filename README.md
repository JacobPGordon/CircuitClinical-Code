# CircuitClinical-Code
Two of the classes I wrote for the intramurals project for Circuit Clinical; the full code was intended to help automate their sorting of clinical trials based on the building they were
in, but the project was hampered by issues with the team and I was only able to finish a partial implementation that I sent to our team's liason. These two classes are not the only code
from the project, but I chose to err on the side of caution on the chance that other, more functional pieces of code concerning the actual algorithm are in use by the company.
